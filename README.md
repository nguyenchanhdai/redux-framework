# Redux Options Framework

Wordpress options framework which uses the [WordPress Settings API](http://codex.wordpress.org/Settings_API "WordPress Settings API"), Custom Error/Validation Handling, Custom Field/Validation Types, and import/export functionality.

## Getting Started with Redux ##

ReduxFramework has been built from the group up as a auto-updating plugin. Updates are served from the Wordpress.org plugin directory. In this way Redux can be used by Themes and Plugins multiple time through the same insance.

To install the plugin, just download the master branch zip file, and install as you would any other Wordpress plugin.


## Creating a config file ##

Inside the plugin directory is a `sample` folder. Copy this into your theme or plugin. DO NOT modify anything within the plugin or you will all your work at each update of the Redux Plugin.

Include the `sample-config.php` file in your theme `functions.php` or plugin as follows:

```php
require_once('path/to/copied/sample/sample-config.php');
```

Edit ```sample-config.php``` as needed.

## FAQs ##

1. Why should we use ```require_once``` instead of ```get_template_part```?
 * First, because ```get_template_part``` is for... you guessed it, themes! Redux is designed to work with both themes *and* plugins.
 * Second, read [this](http://kovshenin.com/2013/get_template_part/).
2. Why shouldn't we edit ```sample-config.php``` in the plugin directory?
 * Because ```sample-config.php``` will be replaced at each update of the plugin. You will lose all your effort
