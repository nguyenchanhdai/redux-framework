Redux is a simple, truly extensible options framework for WordPress themes and plugins and a full demo configuration so you can dive right in!

== Description ==
Redux is a simple, truly extensible options framework for WordPress themes and plugins. Built on the WordPress Settings API, Redux supports a multitude of field types as well as custom error handling, custom field & validation types, and import/export functionality.

But what does Redux actually DO? We don't believe that theme and plugin
developers should have to reinvent the wheel every time they start work on a
project. Redux is designed to simplify the development cycle by providing a
streamlined, extensible framework for developers to build on. Through a
simple, well-documented config file, third-party developers can build out an
options panel limited only by their own imagination in a fraction of the time
it would take to build from the ground up!

NOTE: Redux is not intended to be used on its own. It requires a config file
provided by a third-party theme or plugin developer to actual do anything
cool!

== Installation ==
1. Upload the "ReduxFramework" directory to "/wp-content/plugins/".
2. Activate the plugin through the "Plugins" menu in WordPress.
